# Assignment-2

## HW2: Use Cases and Use Case Diagrams
This assignment is due Monday, 16 September 2013.

Please see the `usecases.tex` file for a basic template to use for the use cases
themselves.

Please see the `fitg-usecases-missions.tex` file for the Missions Use Cases (completed by @cawaltrip) as a specific example of a use case for *Freedom in the Galaxy*.

If you are not comfortable with Git or with LaTeX then just fill
out the information in plain text and paste it into the issue page for the
use case(s) that you are working on and we will make sure someone adds it to
the document.

## Deliverables due:
- ~~Meet with your team. Exchange complete contact and schedule information. Try to figure out when is the best time for your team to meet.~~
- ~~Do a quick study of revision control systems~~
- (Decision: LaTeX) ~~Decide as a team between HTML and LaTeX. Do your semester's work in an ASCII-based document format so that it can be handled by revision control systems.~~
- (Decision: Git & GitHub) ~~Vote on revision control system... (vote to be held by next Monday).~~
- Develop use case descriptions for all the tasks in FitG.
- Develop a use case diagram summarizing those use cases. The open source tool Dia is recommended for UML diagramming. 
- Commit these descriptions and the diagram into a revision control system. (if you need a repository and UNIX group hosted on wormulon, see Dr. J) 
- Send Dr. J instructions by which a copy of your work can be obtained/viewed.

 ### Remaining items
 We are in the process of doing use cases right now, but we will still need to do Use Case Diagrams as well.  Dr. J recommends Dia, but Visio or any other number of diagramming software packages could be used.  We will need to get these done as well.

 We also need to send Dr. J instructions on how to get to our repository - we will need to find out if he wants to log in to grab it, or whether we want to make the repository public.
